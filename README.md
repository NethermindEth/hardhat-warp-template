# Sample Hardhat Project for hardhat-warp

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case, with hardhat-warp configured. It comes with a sample contract and a test for that contract.

Before running the tests you'll need to configure a python virtual environment and install `starknet-devnet`.
You will need `python3.9` for the devnet to function properly.

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install starknet-devnet
```

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat test
```
